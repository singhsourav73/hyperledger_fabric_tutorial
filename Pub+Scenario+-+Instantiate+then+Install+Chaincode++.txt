Lesson to be learned: You need to install chaincode before instantiating it on a channel.

Notes:
Applications in a Hyperledger Fabric network  interact with the blockchain ledger through chaincode.  
Chaincode is installed onto peer nodes and instantiated to one or more channels.
all Chaincode is is software code that's invoked by a client application
