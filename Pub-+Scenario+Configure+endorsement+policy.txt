Configure endorsement policy


Lesson to be learned: Access control defaults exist inside configtx.yaml, the file that configtxgen uses to build channel configurations. 
the configtx.yaml file is located at /root/fabric-samples/first-network/ in our lab


Scenario Tasks: 
Task: configure all the channels within the network to require ANY Admins to write
Task: Start the network afterwards


Variables/Arguments needed:

Notes: 
Fabric uses access control lists or ACLs to manage access to resources by associating a policy — which specifies a rule that evaluates to true or false, given a set of identities — with the resource. 


Fabric contains a number of default ACLs. In this scenario, we’ll look at how they’re formatted and how the defaults can be overridden.


Policies are fundamental to the way Fabric works because they allow the identity (or set of identities) associated with a request to be checked against the policy associated with the resource needed to fulfill the request. Endorsement policies are used to determine whether a transaction has been appropriately endorsed.
