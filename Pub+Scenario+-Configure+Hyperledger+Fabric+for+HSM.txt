Scenario Configure Hyperledger Fabric for HSM
Domains & Competencies 
Membership Service Provider 20%
Configure Hyperledger Fabric for hardware security module
Diagnostics and Troubleshooting 15%
Query and analyse CA logs


Lesson to be learned: 
* On Fabric CA scenarios make sure you jump over to the right documentation link https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/
* edit the fabric-ca-server-config.yaml file to configure HSM


Scenario Tasks: 
* Configure the CA server to store private keys in a HSM via PKCS11.
* Restart the service and validate HSM is operational

Notes: 
By default, the Fabric CA server and client store private keys in a PEM-encoded file, but they can also be configured to store private keys in an HSM (Hardware Security Module) via PKCS11 APIs. This behavior is configured in the BCCSP (BlockChain Crypto Service Provider) section of the server’s or client’s configuration file. Currently, Fabric only supports the PKCS11 standard to communicate with an HSM.
