Install and Instantiate chaincode package


Lesson to be learned: 
You need to install chaincode before instantiating it on a channel.


Scenario Tasks: 
Task:  Install a Node.js chaincode
Task: instantiate the chaincode  


Variables/Arguments needed
peer: peer0.org1.com (default peer on cli container)
version: v2.0.0
name: samplecc
chaincode path: /opt/gopath/src/github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node
channel name: mychannel
init args: ["init","a","1000","b","2000"]


Notes: 
Applications in a Hyperledger Fabric network  interact with the blockchain ledger through chaincode.  
Chaincode is installed onto peer nodes and instantiated to one or more channels.
all Chaincode is is software code that's invoked by a client application
