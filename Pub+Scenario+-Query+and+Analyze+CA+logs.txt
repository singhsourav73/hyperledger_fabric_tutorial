Query and analyse CA logs


Lesson to be learned: 
* On Fabric CA scenarios make sure you jump over to the right documentation link https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/
* fabric-ca-server-config.yaml is vital to troubleshooting


Scenario Tasks: 
* Analyze and fix starting the Fabric CA server

Notes: 


If the server has not been previously initialized, it will initialize itself as it starts for the first time. During this initialization, the server will generate the ca-cert.pem and ca-key.pem files if they don’t yet exist and will also create a default configuration file if it does not exist. 


This default configuration file is named fabric-ca-server-config.yaml and is located in server’s home directory.


among other things this config file can: 
be configured to read from an LDAP server.
configure tls
name of the ca
certificate revocation settings
metrics
pkcs11
default username and password
and more 


you want to be careful with syntax within this file, it could render your server inoperable
